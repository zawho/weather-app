12/4/23 - I am now beginning the weather app project as part of the The Odin Project's Javascript track. I will be making a simple web app that displays 3-day weather forecasts for any location around the world thanks to WeatherAPI. The focus of this project is to practice using promises, async/await, and fetching data from an API.
